EXERCISE 3:

AIM:
To Create Virtual Machine online using Amazon web service.

Virtual Machine:
A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that works like a computer within a computer. It runs 
on an isolated partition of its host computer with its own resources of CPU power, memory, an 
operating system (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS), and other resources. This allows end-users to run 
applications on VMs and use them as they normally would on their workstation.
Virtualization uses software to simulate virtual hardware that allows multiple VMs to run on a single 
machine. The physical machine is known as the host while the VMs running on it are called guests.
This process is managed by software known as a hypervisor. The hypervisor is responsible for 
managing and provisioning resources—like memory and storage—from the host to guests. It also 
schedules operations in Virtual Machines, so they don’t overrun each other when using resources. 
VMs only work if there is a hypervisor to virtualize and distribute host resources.

Advantage:
Resource and cost efficiency
Organizations use virtualization to host multiple VMs on one server. Let’s say an organization wants 
to deploy several applications. Instead of investing in extra servers, they can deploy VMs on one server 
for each application—the same outcome at a fraction of the cost. This improves cost-efficiency since 
the physical hardware is utilized to its maximum capacity.
Scalability
Adding a VM is as simple as cloning copies of existing VMs in the physical machine. Organizations can 
respond better to fluctuations in load, which helps stabilize performance. This is faster and more 
efficient compared to installing different operating systems on physical servers.
Security
VM environments are isolated from the host operating system, which boosts security as vulnerabilities 
like malware don’t impact the underlying hardware. This makes VMs ideal for testing new applications 
or software changes before they enter production.

PROCEDURE:
1. Enter the EC2 Dashboard
2. Create and Configure Your Virtual Machine
3. Click Launch Instance to Amazon EC2 console
4. Click Select to Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Base

Actions button, navigate to Instant State, and click Terminate.
12. Confirm termination - select Yes, Terminate.

RESULT:
Thus, the given virtual machine using Amazon Web Service is created successfully.

EXERCISE 7:

AIM:
To create a developer account in CRM

CRM:
Customer relationship management (CRM) is a technology for managing all your company’s 
relationships and interactions with customers. The goal of CRM is to improve business relationships. 
A CRM system helps companies stay connected to customers, streamline processes, and improve 
profitability.
A customer relationship management (CRM) solution helps you find new customers, win their 
business, and keep them happy by organising customer and prospect information in a way that helps 
you build stronger relationships with them and grow your business faster. CRM systems start by 
collecting a customer's website, email, telephone, social media data, and more, across multiple 
sources and channels. It may also automatically pull in other information, such as recent news about 
the company's activity, and it can store personal details, such as a client's personal preferences on 
communications. The CRM tool organises this information to give you a complete record of individuals 
and companies overall, so you can better understand your relationship over time.
Therefore, an organization is advised to have a developer account in CRM. It brings clarity in each 
action made by the company

PROCEDURE:
1.Create new application e.g., “student”
2.Name the label and create a plural name e.g., “Student details”
3.Click on create app and go to my app page
4.Create a new customer object by searching for object using find operation
5.After creating objects create the input fields
6.Using apex code insert the values to the fields of object

EXERCISE 9:

AIM:
To study and install Apache Hadoop framework.

Hadoop:
Hadoop is an open-source framework for large-scale data processing. Hadoop enables companies to 
retain and make use of all the data they collect, performing complex analysis quickly and storing 
results securely over several distributed servers.
Traditional large-scale data processing was performed on several large computers. The advantage of 
this approach was that the increase in the size of the servers had no effect on the overall system 
architecture. The disadvantage was that scaling up was expensive.
Using a Hadoop framework, large-scale data processing can respond to increased demand by "scaling 
out": if the data set doubles, you distribute processing over two servers; if the data set quadruples, 
you distribute processing over four servers. This eliminates the strategy of growing computing 
capacity by throwing more expensive hardware at the problem.

Modules in Hadoop:
Hadoop common
Hadoop distributed file system
Hadoop YARN
Hadoop MapReduce
Cassandra

Resources needed for Installation:
Host

EXERCISE 10:

AIM:
To Configure a single node cluster using Hadoop framework and write a map reduce application

MAP REDUCE:
-MapReduce is a programming framework that allows us to perform distributed and parallel 
processing on large data sets in a distributed environment.
-MapReduce consists of two distinct tasks — Map and Reduce.
-As the name MapReduce suggests, reducer phase takes place after the mapper phase has been 
completed.
-So, the first is the map job, where a block of data is read and processed to produce key-value pairs as 
intermediate outputs.
-The output of a Mapper or map job (key-value pairs) is input to the Reducer., The reducer receives 
the key-value pair from multiple map jobs.
-Then, the reducer aggregates those intermediate data tuples (intermediate key-value pair) into a 
smaller set of tuples or key-value pairs which is the final output.

PRCEDURE:
Step 1: Installing Java, is the primary requirement for running Hadoop on any system, so make sure 
you have Java installed on your system.
Step 2: Creating Hadoop User, we recommend creating a normal (nor root) account for Hadoop
working. So, create a system account using following command.
Step 3: Downloading Hadoop 2.6.0,Now download Hadoop 2.6.0 source archive file using below 
command. You can also select alternate download mirror for increasing download speed.
Step 4: Configure Hadoop Pseudo-Distributed Mode, first we need to set environment variable uses 
by Hadoop. Hadoop has many of configuration files, which need to configure as per requirements of 
your Hadoop infrastructure. Now format the name node using commands.
Step 5: Start Hadoop Cluster, Let’s start your Hadoop cluster using the scripts provides by Hadoop. 
Just navigate to your Hadoops bin directory and execute scripts one by one.
Step 6: Access Hadoop Services in Browser, Hadoop Name Node started on port 50070 default. Access 
your server on port 50070 in your favourite web browser.

MAP-REDUCE ALGORITHM :
-The input data can be divided into n number of chunks depending upon the amount of data and 
processing capacity of individual unit.
-Next, it is passed to the mapper functions. Please note that all the chunks are processed 
simultaneously at the same time, which embraces the parallel processing of data.
-After that, shuffling happens which leads to aggregation of similar patterns.
-Finally, reducers combine them all to get a consolidated output as per the logic.
-This algorithm embraces scalability as depending on the size of the input data, we can keep increasing 
the number of the parallel processing units.

RESULT:
Thus, the Map Reducer application executed successfully.
